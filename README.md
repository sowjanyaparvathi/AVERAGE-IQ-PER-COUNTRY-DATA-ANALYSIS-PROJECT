# AVERAGE-IQ-PER-COUNTRY-DATA-ANALYSIS-PROJECT
Average IQ per Country – Data Analysis Project
This project performs a basic exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset containing average IQ scores across different countries. Using Python and pandas, the analysis uncovers patterns and insights about global intelligence distribution.

📂 Dataset
The dataset avgIQpercountry.csv contains two primary columns:

Country: Name of the country.

IQ: Average intelligence quotient (IQ) score of the country.

📊 Objectives
Load and inspect the dataset.

Perform descriptive statistics on IQ scores.

Visualize the distribution of IQ scores.

Identify countries with the highest and lowest IQs.

🛠 Tech Stack
Language: Python

Libraries: pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, Jupyter Notebook

📝 Key Insights
Identification of top and bottom countries by IQ score.

Statistical summaries including mean, median, and standard deviation of IQ scores.

Visualization of IQ distribution globally.
